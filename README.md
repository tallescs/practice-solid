# practice-solid
Part of daily plan for studying SOLID principles.

Based on Ardalis repo[https://github.com/ardalis/SolidSample] and his Pluralsight Course.

The ISP branch is equal to LSP branch because I didn't like the code introduced at ISP Module at the course because all it's code is replaced/deleted later.
I think it is the only downside of this course and I may practice this principle using other problem/refactor example.

The test cases aren't sufficient, but it's not the focus of this practice and I may increase test coverage soon.

The code target .NetCore 5 and C# 8, but I don't use all the resources to reduce code, like the new switch syntax, because it's not the focus of this practice.
